I have completed a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering with an impressive 8.66 CGPA from Sanjeevan Engineering & Technology Institute, Panhala, Kolhapur. I also completed a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering with a score of 68.80% from Sharad Institute of Technology, Polytechnic, Yadrav, Kolhapur.

In addition to my educational qualifications, I have extensive knowledge and experience in software testing and automation. I am proficient in Core Java, Manual Testing, Selenium, SQL, and API Testing. I have hands-on experience in creating test plans, executing tests, and identifying defects. For instance, during my Software Testing course at QSpiders Pune, I learned the best practices for writing, reviewing, and executing test cases, which helped me identify critical defects that would have been otherwise missed.

I have also worked on several projects that demonstrate my skills in automation testing. One such project is "Design and Analysis of Drilling Fixture for BT40 Gripper Plate." I designed and analyzed a fixture for a BT40 gripper plate, which involved the creation of automated test scripts using Selenium to test the functionality of the fixture. As a result, we were able to identify and fix several defects early in the development process, resulting in a higher quality product.

Moreover, I am well-versed in Agile and Scrum methodologies and can work seamlessly with cross-functional teams.
